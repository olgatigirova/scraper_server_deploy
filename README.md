Scraper http server supports the following paths:
- / GET request
- /api/search/ GET request
- /api/search/ DELETE request
- /api/search/ POST request
- /api/search/list/ GET request
- /docs GET request
  "Try" functionality does not work on heroku, because heroku disables sending valid Request URL.
